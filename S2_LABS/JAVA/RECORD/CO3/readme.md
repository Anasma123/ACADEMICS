# CO2 Java Programs

This directory contains Java programs that demonstrate various concepts such as method overloading, inheritance, array operations, and class structures. The following programs are included:

---

### Q1  
**Area of different shapes using overloaded functions**  
This program demonstrates the use of method overloading to calculate the area of different shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles. Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are used to compute the area.

### Q2  
**Create a class ‘Employee’ with data members Empid, Name, Salary, Address and constructors to initialize the data members. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherits the properties of class Employee and contains its own data members department, subjects taught, and constructors to initialize these data members. Also, include a display function to display all the data members. Use an array of objects to display the details of N teachers.**  
This program demonstrates inheritance in Java. The `Employee` class is extended by the `Teacher` class, which adds additional properties like department and subjects taught. The program uses an array of objects to store and display information about multiple teachers.

### Q3  
**Create a class ‘Person’ with data members Name, Gender, Address, Age, and a constructor to initialize the data members. Another class ‘Employee’ inherits the properties of class `Person` and adds its own data members like Empid, Company_name, Qualification, Salary, and its own constructor. Create another class ‘Teacher’ that inherits the properties of class `Employee` and contains its own data members like Subject, Department, Teacherid. Include constructors and methods to display the data members. Use an array of objects to display the details of N teachers.**  
This program demonstrates the use of multiple inheritance using classes `Person`, `Employee`, and `Teacher`. Each class builds on the previous one, adding more specific attributes, and all data members are displayed using an array of objects.

### Q4  
**Write a program with classes Publisher, Book, Literature, and Fiction. Read the information and print the details of books from either category using inheritance.**  
This program uses inheritance to create different types of books. The `Publisher` class is the base class, and the `Book`, `Literature`, and `Fiction` classes inherit from it, with specific attributes and behaviors for each category of books. The program reads data and displays information about books in the respective categories.

### Q5  
**Create classes Student and Sports. Create another class Result inherited from Student and Sports. Display the academic and sports score of a student.**  
This program demonstrates inheritance by creating a `Student` class and a `Sports` class, and then combining both in a `Result` class. The program calculates and displays both the academic and sports scores for each student.
